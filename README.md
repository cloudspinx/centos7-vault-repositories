# CentOS 7 Vault Repositories (End-of-Life - Limited Use)

This repository contains `.repo` files for the CentOS 7 Vault repositories.

Important Note:

> CentOS 7 reached its end-of-life (EOL) on December 31, 2021. These vault repositories provide limited access to critical security updates for a short grace period only. They are not intended as a long-term solution.

This repository is intended for:

- **Informational purposes**: See the structure and content of the CentOS 7 vault repositories.
- **Emergency situations**: Potentially address critical security vulnerabilities on a system that cannot be migrated immediately.

**Warning**:
> Using these repositories for ongoing use is strongly discouraged due to limited availability and lack of future updates. It is highly recommended to migrate to a supported alternative like Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux for continued security and stability.
